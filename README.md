## Problem Statement
In resource-constrained healthcare environments, expert medical image annotation is expensive and time-consuming. While Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) reduces this burden, standard SSL methods (like FixMatch) suffer from **Silent Failures**—classifying ambiguous images incorrectly but with high confidence.

**Our Solution:** We introduce an **Uncertainty-Guided Safety Filter** that leverages Monte Carlo Dropout. By rejecting ambiguous pseudo-labels based on both confidence and uncertainty, we significantly reduce overconfident clinical errors.

##  Key Contributions
- ** Dual-Path Architecture:** Seamlessly integrates standard Supervised Learning (20% data) with an Uncertainty-Guided SSL teacher-student model (80% unlabeled data).
- ** Two-Layer Safety Mechanism:** Filters unreliable predictions using a strict criteria.
- ** Low-Resource Optimized:** Built on a lightweight ResNet-18 backbone, making it highly suitable for edge deployment in rural clinics.

## Results & Clinical Impact

We evaluated our framework on the task of Malaria Cell Classification. Our method outperforms standard SSL baselines by specifically targeting dangerous "silent failures."

| Method | Accuracy | AUC | Silent Failure Rate (SFR) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Supervised Baseline (20% Labels) | 96.7% | 0.989 | 2.01% |
| FixMatch (Standard SSL, τ=0.80) | 96.4% | 0.991 | 2.50% |
| **Ours (SafeMed-SSL)** | **96.6%** | **0.991** | **1.77%** |

> **Impact:** We achieved a statistically significant **29.2% reduction in silent failures** ($p=0.0137$), directly preventing dangerous misdiagnoses.
